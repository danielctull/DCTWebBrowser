h1. DCTWebBrowser

DCTWebBrowser is a UIViewController subclass to act as an internal browser for apps.

The single class can be modally presented (on its own or as the root of a UINavigationController) or pushed onto a UINavigationController stack.

h2. Adding DCTWebBrowser to your app

# Drop *DCTWebBrowser.xcodeproj* into your application's project
# Add libDCTWebBrowser.a in the *Link Binary With Libraries* build phase for your app's target
# Add DCTWebBrowser.bundle (found in the Products group in DCTWebBrowser.xcodeproj) to the *Copy Bundle Resources* build phase for your app's target
# Add @#import <DCTWebBrowser/DCTWebBrowser.h>@ when you want to use it

h2. Use

The Xcode project includes a demo target, to show the different ways a DCTWebBrowser can be displayed. It's flexible enough to be able to be both pushed and presented on its own or as the root view controller of a UINavigationController. The following yield very similar results:

h3. Pushed onto a UINavigationController stack

<pre>
DCTWebBrowser *webBrowser = [DCTWebBrowser new];
NSURLRequest *request = [[NSURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://apple.com"]];
[webBrowser loadRequest:request];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:webBrowser animated:YES];
</pre>

h3. Presented with a UINavigationController

<pre>
DCTWebBrowser *webBrowser = [DCTWebBrowser new];
NSURLRequest *request = [[NSURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://apple.com"]];
[webBrowser loadRequest:request];
UINavigationController *navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:webBrowser];
[self presentViewController:navigationController animated:YES completion:NULL];
</pre>

h3. Presented on its own

<pre>
DCTWebBrowser *webBrowser = [DCTWebBrowser new];
NSURLRequest *request = [[NSURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://apple.com"]];
[webBrowser loadRequest:request];
[self presentViewController:webBrowser animated:YES completion:NULL];
</pre>
